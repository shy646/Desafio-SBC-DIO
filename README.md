Project DIO (Digital Innovation One)

The objective of this project was to create a comprehensive representation of a banking environment, focusing on the structuring and implementation of modular classes for various essential components. I utilized classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, with each playing a role in simulating the banking system and creating organized and reusable code.

The main functionality of the project includes operations such as user registration, creation of current accounts, deposits, withdrawals, display of statements, and transaction history. I employed best programming practices to ensure data integrity, input validation, and error handling.
